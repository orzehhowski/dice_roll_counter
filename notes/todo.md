- ~~learn how CNN works~~
- define and train model
  - ~~image preprocessing~~
  - openCV dice recognition (HoughCircles for pips recognition)
  - CNN network
- buy rpi camera
- export model with TF serving for external API and TF lite for local usage on rpi (I want to do it both ways)
- create and deploy API app
- create raspberry pi client app
- learn how to design 3d stuff
- design and print on 3d printer dice arena model with rpi slot and lights

current data processing approach:
1. preprocess with opencv
2. recognize dices with custom cnn
3. pips counter with HoughCircles in opencv
